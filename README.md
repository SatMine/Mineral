# Mineral
## Technical Architecture
### Based on the Ordinals Protocol
The Mineral protocol is built on the foundation of the Ordinals protocol, leveraging its robust infrastructure to support the creation and transaction of NFT Inscription. The openness of the Ordinals protocol provides a reliable foundation for the extension of the Mineral protocol.
Sats Pricing Mechanism
The Mineral protocol introduces a Sats pricing mechanism, enabling flexible payments and rewards in the smallest unit of Bitcoin. This mechanism drives broader use cases and facilitates more nuanced economic model designs.
### Inscription Minting Mechanism
The Inscription minting mechanism is at the core of the Mineral protocol, allowing users to create NFT Inscription with computational capabilities by initiating Taproot transactions. The integration of Taproot and the Ordinals protocol ensures the uniqueness and security of Inscription NFTs.
MRC20 Token Reward Mechanism
The Mineral protocol introduces an MRC20 token reward mechanism, enabling users to earn corresponding token rewards through NFT Inscription mining activities. The mechanism is designed to synchronize with Bitcoin block generation, achieving efficient and cost-effective token generation.
### Decentralized Governance
The Mineral protocol supports decentralized governance, empowering users with community governance rights through Inscription tokens. This feature enables users to participate in decision-making, fostering a more democratic and open community governance.
### Open Source Nature
The Mineral protocol adheres to open-source principles, providing a transparent and auditable technical implementation. This openness not only strengthens user trust but also offers developers and researchers the opportunity to participate and contribute collaboratively, driving the continuous evolution of the protocol.
